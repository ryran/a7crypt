TO INSTALL a7crypt FOR ALL USERS

(1) Copy a7crypt over to say /usr/local/bin/ and make sure it is executable
  • On sudo-enabled system, like Ubuntu: 
sudo cp a7crypt /usr/local/bin/; sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/a7crypt
  • If that doesn't work:
su -lc 'cp a7crypt /usr/local/bin/; chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/a7crypt'

(2) Next, to create an application shortcut for all users, you need to copy everything from the line beginning with '[Desktop' to the line ending with 'Accessories;' and paste it into a file /usr/share/applications/a7crypt.desktop. Alternatively, you could run the following, by copy and paste.

  • On sudo-enabled system, like Ubuntu:
sudo cat > /usr/share/applications/a7crypt.desktop <<\EOF
[Desktop Entry]
Name=a7crypt
Comment=Simple symmetric encryption GUI using GPG or OpenSSL
Exec=a7crypt
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Icon=/usr/share/pixmaps/password.png
Categories=GNOME;Accessories;
EOF

  • If that doesn't work:
su -lc 'cat > /usr/share/applications/a7crypt.desktop <<\EOF
[Desktop Entry]
Name=a7crypt
Comment=Simple symmetric encryption GUI using GPG or OpenSSL
Exec=a7crypt
Terminal=false
