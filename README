# System requirements: zenity and one of either gpg, gpg2, or openssl.
#
# The original goal of this project was to make ASCII-armor text-{en,de}cryption
# more accessible and easy to use for people that spend all their time in GUIs.
# That goal has been reached -- in as satisfactory of a way as is possible,
# until I learn python, that is -- so the next piece will be to add the ability
# to encrypt/decrypt files.
#
# It almost goes without saying, but a requirement of this was that security not
# be in any way sacrificed for this convenience.
#
# To that end: no processes are run with arguments of a passphrase, nor are
# passphrases or message data stored on disk; the script creates a working dir
# in ram that is only readable by the current user and whenever message data or
# passphrases need to be stored, they are stored there and deleted as soon as
# they have served their purpose. (Note: We WILL fall-back to creating a working
# dir on disk if /dev/shm is unavailable for some crazy reason.)
#
# We of course want to ensure that all tmpfiles are cleaned up on exit. A simple
# trap will cover exiting due to receiving a sigterm or sigint, but for sigkill,
# we need something more. So each time our script runs, we create lockfiles with
# our PID and the location of the temp working directory. That way, if an old
# instance of the script ever dies without cleaning up its potentially-sensitive
# data, we can take out the trash the next time we run.
#
# When lockfiles & temp directories are created by this script, we name them
# based on the script's current filename; not some static project name. This
# means that you can feel free to rename the script. Everything else will go
# along with the new name--you don't need to change anything in the content.
#  
# Feel free to hit me/the tracker up if you have any questions or suggestions!
