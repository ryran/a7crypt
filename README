# The goal of this project is to make ASCII-armor text-{en,de}cryption more
# accessible and easy to use for people that spend all their time in GUIs.
# It almost goes without saying, but a requirement of this was that security not
# be in any way sacrificed for this convenience.
#
# To that end: no processes are run with arguments of a passphrase, nor are
# passphrases or message data stored on disk; the script creates a working dir
# in ram that is only readable by the current user and whenever message data or
# passphrases need to be stored, they are stored there and deleted as soon as
# they have served their purpose.

# System requirements: zenity and one of either gpg, gpg2, or openssl.
# Also, for /dev/shm, any modern (2.6+) linux kernel should do.
#  
# Feel free to hit me up if you have any questions or suggestions.
